1. TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning that has a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources driving upgrades and *Machine Learning* development. TensorFlow makes it easy to build a model using high-level APIs like Keras with fast execution and easy debugging. In addition, TensorFlow delivers powerful ML production with modeling deployments in the cloud, location, browser, and more regardless of the language you use as well as a simple and flexible architecture that brings new ideas to cutting-edge models. Thus, making publication faster.

TensorFlow itself is also implemented in several fields, such as IoT (Image Classification, Object Detection, Pose Estimation, Smart Reply, Segmentation, Style Transfer, Text Classification, Natural Language Question Answering, and others)

In the production sector, TensorFlow takes advantage of the use of TFX. TFX is Google's production scale *Machine Learning* platform based on TensorFlow. It provides a shared library and configuration framework for integrating the common components needed to define, launch and monitor your machine learning system.

One of its applications is the Neural Network, Neural Machine Translation with Attention and the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network which can produce handwritten digit images using the Keras Sequential API.

2. Android + Flutter

Now the development of Android is very large and is in the stage of updating Android 11. Now Beta 3 is available for testing and development on your device. Some of the things included in Android 11 are behavior changes that can affect applications while running, privacy features to protect user privacy, and new features and APIs for 5G, sharing, connectivity, media, NNAPI, biometrics, and much more. Android 11 has also been introduced to Android TV, Media Control, and many more.

The UI for Android itself turns out to be configured with Google's UI toolkit called Flutter. Flutter can provide a more beautiful, attractive design, and an efficient, fast processing process. Flutter itself can be implemented for almost all types of platforms, such as mobile, web, desktop app.

3. Google Ads API

The Google Ads API is a modern interface to the next generation Google Ads and AdWords API. This allows development to interact directly with the Google Ads platform, greatly increasing the efficiency of managing large or complex Google Ads accounts and campaigns. Some common use cases include:
- Ad management based on inventory
- Manage Smart Bidding strategies with Google Ads API. You can create software that manages accounts from the customer level to the keyword level.
- The API can also do what the Google Ads UI does, but programmatically
